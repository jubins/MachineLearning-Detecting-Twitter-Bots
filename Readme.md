# Detecting Bots on Twitter Using Machine Learning

Twitter bot is a program used to produce automated posts, follow Twitter users or serve as spam to entice clicks on the Twitter microblogging service. In this project, we will use Machine Learning techniques to predict whether an account on Twitter is a Bot or a real user. We have performed significant amount of feature engineering, along with feature extraction - selected features out of 20 helped us to identify whether an account is bot or non bot. We implemented various algorithm but finally implemented our own which gave us AUC>95%.
